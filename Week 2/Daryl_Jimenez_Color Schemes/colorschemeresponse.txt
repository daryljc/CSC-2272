Of the four sites I found, the most visually-appealing one from the bunch
has to be Soilboy. Their dissimulated use of a color that matches the 
pigmentation of each plant for the background is impressive; it is a color
that nearly embodies the natural world in my mind. They also cleverly 
repurpose this color with a lighter hue of it for spots that long for 
contrast in order for effective presentation to be executed. Props to 
them in general.

3.,
I chose a complementary color scheme as I personally found that resorting 
to singularity when it comes to a website makes it quite bland. It was also
quite simple to implement into my website considering the grid system that 
I opted for in the creation of the site; going for a color triad or a set 
of 3 analogous colors would have posed to be more taxing in comparison to
2 complementary colors.
