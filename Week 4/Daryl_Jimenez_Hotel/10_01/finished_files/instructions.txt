Client Updates:
Dear Web Dev team, please update my site. I don’t have the time to do it myself.

7. Please add another page called “Spa”. We have massages and a nail spa. Please
add some nice pictures. The massages price list is available at the check in desk.
We do not want to post the prices on the website because the owner of the spa is a
nightmare to work with and keeps changing her mind. We couldn’t possibly keep up
with her so for now, we will just list prices are available at check in. Please add their
phone number too: 44.555.121212. Make sure you have an nice favicon for that new
page. I don’t want it to look odd.
